folderclone - A project which allows you copy public folders to a Shared Drive using Google Service Accounts from GSuite Business or GSuite Education accounts.
=================================

Requirements for using the scripts
---------------------------------
* Python 3.7+ (Use 64-Bit Python only)
* The following modules from pip3: `oauth2client`, `google-api-python-client`, `progress` & `httplib2shim`

Short descriptions for each script
---------------------------------
* `betterclone.py` - An easy to use script which takes very few steps to setup but doesn't work.
* `multifolderclone.py` - A script which requires a slightly lengthier setup process, but much quicker at cloning files than betterclone.
